# NFL Analytics
This is a python script I wrote based off of [This tutorial](https://github.com/nickwan/nfl-qb-td-tutorial) that uses linear regression to predict next year's QB touchdowns. The script also creates PNG graphs of the data as well as CSV files so users can do more manual data analytics if they so choose.

I plan on adding more models for WR and RB data as well.
